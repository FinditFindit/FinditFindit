- I thought the appropriate name for my profile should be FinditFindit. Because the things I learned about me and the reason for me crawling down this rabbit hole is because the things that I learned about me recently completely caught me off guard. I'm looking for people that can help me with the most biggest challenge that Bitcoin has ever faced, a person asking github for help.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Technology. How to avoid getting your phone rooted to a phone call how to avoid? How to recover Bitcoin I haven't touched since May 27 2014.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Cyber security measures
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Knowledgeable information that can lead me down to the path to explore more knowledge or better yetopen doors to more opportunities
- 📫 How to reach me ... With all the phone hacking and rooting going on nowadays with developer companies like coinbase which is a software development company also I realize one thing about technology is that you have to mask your Truth identity however create something to rout so the address you see as my contact email address it's very valid and if someone is knowledgeable about it they understand that it will route to my real email address once i validate your good intentions then I will give you a direct contact I have no problem giving you a direct contact but security caution is one thing I've learned over a couple of months of trying to claim my coin. Today I purchased this coin in May 27 2014 and the only reason I know the exact date because it's my best friend's death date however this was sent to the US Treasury without a social attached or a email address it was just my name my current home address and it also has a ID number and a claim number that has already been claimed by me Bitcoin on you sent 27 dollars of the 600 that I sent so I assumed that the 27th was from the day of 27th to keep an eye on what they're doing I'm not sure but just don't be required help from someone.
